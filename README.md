# Broken String Biosciences Bioinformatician pre-interview coding test

Here I have developed a pipeline written in Nextflow to process the samples as described in README_old.md

In order to run the pipeline:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```

You can find all modifiable paramerters in the nextflow.config file, all results by default are output to the directory ./results.

I have written a report in `cardenas_report.html` which includes the answers to the questions asked.
